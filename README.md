# A python program that changes the windows background image to a random image

This simple python program uses the unplash api to download a random image and place it as a background image in your Windows PC.

Change the paths to match those of your system 

If you add the main script to the _shell:startup_ you can have a random background image every time you boot your PC. (This is why I made it btw)

Enjoy!!
